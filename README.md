Old Style Utility Meter Card for Home Assistant

Customizable Utility Meter Card based on old style (non digital) utility meter box with rotating digits and an animated spinning wheel :new:.<br/>
The card supports now up to 9 independent counters!<br/>
This picture does a better job than describing it with words:

This is my first custom card project.

# Configuration

Colors of almost all elements can be set to custom values.<br/>
Font of digits can be either default (used by your HA dashboard) or Carlito, which is more resembling the font used on meter boxes.<br/>
This card supports visual configuration editor.<br/>

## About configuration options

Most of these options are pretty straightforward a don't need any explanation. You can find some hints in the visual configuration editor for most of the options.<br/>
**Colors:** all color options (those ending with _color) must be entered in a CSS compatible syntax, e.g, ```"red", "#02DD7F", "#fff", "rgb(120, 120, 120)", "rgba(64, 64, 64, 0.75)"```...

**Spinning wheel:** The rotating speed of the wheel can be either constant or dynamic based on value of optional entity (e.g. Power, Current, Flow etc.).

Select the mode for speed config:
```
speed_control_mode: Fixed | Power | Realistic
```

In **```Fixed```** mode you set only the speed:
```
wheel_speed: 2
```

The number can be set in range -20 to 20 with 0.1 steps, where 0 means the wheel rotation will be disabled, the absolute value of any other number is **the time of a single rotation in seconds**. That means the closer is the number to zero, the faster will the wheel spin. Negative values will spin the wheel in reverse direction.

In **```Power```** mode you must set the **```power_entity```** and the values for transforming the value of sensor to rotation time.

**```power_entity: sensor.my_power_meter_3000_power```** - this is the entity providing the source value for wheel speed

**```max_power_value: 10```** - this is the maximum expected value of the sensor at which the wheel should spin at maximum speed. Let's say you have a single phase smart socket with power monitoring capability, the usual max. would be 3.6 kW. For three phase meters connected to main household connection this value will be significantly higher.

**```max_rot_time: 20```** - the time of a single rotation (in seconds) at minimal power (minimal value of the sensor above)

**```min_rot_time: 1```** - the time of a single rotation (in seconds) at maximum power (maximum value of the sensor above)

The formula for calculating the rotation time from these values is the following:

> rotation_time = (max_rot_time + min_rot_time \* power_val / max_power_value) - (max_rot_time \* power_val / max_power_value)

**Negative sensor values will reverse the wheel direction**. (Thanks to [@JoKohono](https://github.com/JoKohono))

The **```Realistic```** mode is similar to **```Power```** mode, but uses a simplified calculation formula, for more realistic outcome.
You have to set the **```power_entity```** and the number of rotations per consumed kWh (or any other unit your sensor gives):
```
rot_time_per_kwh: 75
```
The calculation formula for this mode is the following:

> rotation_time = ((3600 / rot_time_per_kwh) \* 1000) / power_val

**Important note:** If your Power sensor reports the power value in kW instead of W, multiply the above value by 1000, e.g.
```
rot_time_per_kwh: 75000
```
Credit for the Realistic mode goes to [@Khodrin](https://github.com/Khodrin), thank you!


### Adding more counters
You can add more counters to your card (up to 9 in total). The visual editor doesn't support this yet, you have to specify them in YAML (code editor).<br/>
Options for additional counters have to end with a number suffix, e.g. ```_2``` for second counter, ```_3``` for third etc.
Example for adding a second counter:
```
entity_2: sensor.smart_plug_kitchen_energy
whole_digit_number_2: 5
decimal_digit_number_2: 2
scale_2: 100
decimal_separator_2: Comma
icon_2: mdi:lightning-bolt
random_shift_2: 2
markings_2: true
show_name_2: true
name_2: Kitchen Counter Energy Consumption
decimal_plate_color_2: "#eebb11"
```

## Manual HACS install:
Use [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/), follow the [instructions for adding a custom repository](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories).

- Click on **HACS** in your HA side panel.
- Then click on three dots in upper right corner, choose **Custom repositories**.
- Paste the address of this repository into **Repository** field (`https://github.com/LuckyG3000/old-style-utility-meter-card`)
- Choose **Dashboard** in **Type** dropdown, click **Add**.
- The **Old Style Utility Meter Card** should appear in the list, click the three dots next to it and select **Download**.
- When asked to **Reload**, confirm it.
- Now you can add the card in your dashboard, click **Add card** and scroll to Custom cards. There you'll find the **Old Style Utility Meter Card**.
